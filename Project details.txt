## Inspiration
The game MiniMetro and it's easy going play style were a great source of inspiration.

## What it does
The player uses their mouse to find the best possible path while having a limited number of tracks.

## How we built it
- We used a framework called **Love2D** and the scripting language, **Lua** to code everything. 
- Our sprites were drawn in **Libresprite** which is an open-source drawing software.
- The music was acquired from the Creative Commons at **FreeMusicArchives.com**
- The cloud background was from the **CC0 backgrounds pack by Stealthix **on itch.io.

## Challenges we ran into
- Everything was done without a Graphical User Interface and that made minor changes difficult
- Difficulty building the rail drawing system from the ground up and having the images be reactive to their position relative to other rails.
- Learning how to use the framework.
- Very difficult game logic
- Inadequate sleep
- Problem with making sure the graphics all fit together aesthetically.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Building a mostly responsive rail track system!
- Creating multiple levels
- Not using a game engine.

## What we learned
- Frameworks are great but not good for collaborating code and ideas with a team
- You cannot avoid sleep. It will come for you.

## What's next for Train Lines
- Adding more than two stations for more complex puzzles.
- Adding a timer to increase challenge.
- Better graphics.
